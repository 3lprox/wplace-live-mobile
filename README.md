# wplace-live-mobile
wplace is a website where you can paint like the r/place experiment on Reddit, only now it's globally accessible. Now the interesting part: Why this app? For a few but valid reasons. 1: wplace works terribly on mobile. 2: Can you paint without your mobile Wi-Fi being terrible? 3: Can you use an app that has everything you need on wplace without ad?
